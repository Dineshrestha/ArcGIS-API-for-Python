Common data types include literals, variables, lists, tuples, and dictionaries, but other types of data can be used as well. Data can be explicitly defined within a script, such as with a variable that is assigned to a specific number, or it can be referenced from a source outside of your script, such as a list of numbers pulled from a spreadsheet.\n",

Python includes a variety of built-in functions, such as pow(), str(), and print(), which return the power of a number, a text version of a number, and a printout of results. Python can also use functions from imported modules, such as the square root function from the math module (math.sqrt()), as well as user-defined functions to perform custom-made operations.\n",
